# ROADMAP

## [0.12.0]

- more functionality of [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html) (without copying the API)
- more functional style of the API ([like Scala has](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html))
- deprecate API parts not fitting the functional style

## [0.13.0]

- maybe Go Generics are in place
- see, how we can shift towards more typesavety (using interface{} everywhere is ugly)
